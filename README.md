# UCABeamerTheme

## About the structure
You may have see that all files were inside the `./theme` directory. If you want to use this theme, you have two choices :  
 
 - Put every files inside the `./theme` folder and subfolders at the root of the directory (where your `.tex` is located)
 - Compile using the python script

If you have no use of the script, you can remove it.

### makefile.py
This script simply extract every files contained in the `./theme` folder and subfolders at the root, execute pdflatex then put everything back in place. I made this because I like to keep my folders clean and well organised. :sheep:  
It also put auxiliary files generated by PDFLaTeX inside a folder `./output_cleanup`. 

#### LaTeXTools Integration (Sublime Text)
If you use LaTeXTools, you can add the script as your default builder. Simply paste this in your user settings `(Preferences > Package Settings > LaTeXTools > Settings - User)` :  
```
"builder_settings" : {
  // ...
  "windows" : {
    "script_commands":
      [["python", "makefile.py"]]
  },
  "linux" : {
    "script_commands":
      [["python", "makefile.py"]]
  }
},
```
## Warning
This theme is made to be generated using pdflatex.  
I do not guarantee the result with any other compiler.

## Known issue(s)

When closing a block `\end{block}`, the block crops the bottom of the object if the last element is not a text.

- Fix : Add `\\` before closing the block.
